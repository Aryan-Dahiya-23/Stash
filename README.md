# Stash Wallet

Stash Wallet is a self-custody crypto wallet built using Solana Web3.js, designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for managing your Solana assets. This is a prototype developed for the Colosseum Hackathon, aimed at breaking down the barriers to mass adoption in the crypto space by integrating advanced features that prioritize user convenience, security, and innovation.

## Features

The current prototype of Stash Wallet includes the following functionalities:

- **Create Wallet:** Easily create a new Solana wallet with just a few clicks.
- **Import Wallet:** Import an existing wallet using a seed phrase or private key.
- **Password Lock for Wallet:** Secure your wallet with a password lock to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Send and Receive Solana:** Send and receive Solana (SOL) directly from the wallet interface.
- **Unique Name Generation:** Generate a unique name that is linked to your wallet address. This name can be used to send and receive Solana, providing an easier way to manage transactions.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** An added layer of security where the user must enter the wallet password right before sending Solana.
- **NFT Interface Design:** The prototype includes an interface design for viewing and managing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).
- **Vault:** Securely store sensitive information and private assets within a protected environment.
- **Swapping Tokens:** Prototype includes an interface design for token swapping within the wallet.
